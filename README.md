# Caeli

Group project in the course [IN2000 Software Engineering at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN2000/), spring 2019 - grade: A.

Caeli is an app that is designed to allow users in
          an easy and fast way to see the air quality in the desired
          geographical area, either by use of GPS or an built-in search
          function, in Norway in real time, as well as for the previous and next
          24 hours. In addition, users can easily get information about health
          advice for different levels of pollution and for different user
          groups. Caeli also allows users to customize the application according
          to their own personal preferences so that they can filter out
          information and services they may find unnecessary or irrelevant.
